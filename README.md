UE_Neurosync_Agent
UE_Neurosync_Agent is an Unreal Engine plugin that integrates the NeuroSync framework to enable real-time facial animation from audio input. It uses advanced machine learning to synchronize facial expressions with speech, bringing lifelike realism to virtual characters.

✨ Features
🎤 Real-Time Audio-to-Face Animation
Converts audio features into facial blendshapes using the NeuroSync model in real time.

👤 MetaHuman Integration
Works seamlessly with Unreal Engine’s MetaHuman characters for high-fidelity animations.

🔄 LiveLink Support
Streams animation data into Unreal Engine via LiveLink for smooth real-time previews.

🔧 Customizable Blueprint Interface
Easily integrate and customize with a visual interface inside Unreal Engine.

🧰 Requirements
Unreal Engine 5.1 or later
